                <h1>Current World Situation With Coronavirus</h1>
                <p>There are currently 15.9M confirmed cases and 642K deaths from the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak as of Jul 27, 2020, 02:34 GMT. </p>
                    <h2>Have you ever think what is the impact in the economy? or our lives?</h2>
                <p>Investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that government action may not be enough to stop the decline.
                   In response, central banks in many countries, including the United Kingdom, slashed interest rates.
                    
                  That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy.
                    
                  Global markets did also recover some ground in late March after the US Senate passed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses.
                    
                  But some analysts have warned that they could be volatile until the pandemic is contained.</p>
                  <p>We have power to change the way of coronavirus!</p>
                <h3>We can make the difference!</h3>
                <p> COVID-19 pandemic is challenging us in ways we could never have predicted just a few months ago, from unprecedented amounts of family time to homeschooling to working remotely — or not working at all. These sudden, rapid changes in the way we live, coupled with uncertainty, can feel overwhelming, especially for parents of young children. While we may know that it’s usually helpful for everyone in the family when parents stay positive, it’s sometimes easier said than done. Here are some things to remember:

                 It will not be this way forever. This is a difficult time, but it is just that — a time.
                 Recognize what you are doing well. It may be tough right now, but you have managed some things really well. Think about the physical, logistical, mental and emotional struggles you may have encountered in the last month, and the good — even great — way you approached and handled those challenges. Go you!
                 Remind yourself of what is good in your life. Some circumstances right now may be hard to change, or contribute to your feeling helpless. But there are other things in your life that are good and inspire gratitude. Making a list of the good things that you appreciate — large or small — can help shift your focus in a positive direction.</p>
